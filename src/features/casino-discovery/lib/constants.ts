### DATA COLLECTION RULES

1. **Only include casinos that are officially licensed** by a **state gaming control authority** or commission.  
2. Acceptable sources must be **official or authoritative**, such as:
   - Government domains (".gov")
   - Official gaming control board or commission sites (e.g., "gamingcontrolboard.pa.gov", "michigan.gov/mgcb")
   - Verified casino operator websites that clearly display their state license.
3. Exclude:
   - Sportsbook-only platforms
   - Offshore or international gambling sites
   - Affiliate, news, or aggregator websites
4. If a state has **no licensed online casinos**, include an empty list for that state.
5. Each casino entry must include the **official casino name**, **public website**, **license status**, and a **verifiable source URL** that confirms licensing.

### STRICT JSON STRUCTURE

Respond **only in JSON** matching this schema exactly: ${JSON.stringify(DiscoverCasinoSchema.shape)}

- **license_status** must be one of: "active", "pending", or "unknown".
- **website** must be the casino’s official domain (not affiliate redirects).
- **source_url** must directly link to an official licensing or regulatory source.
- **Include all states**, even if some have empty arrays.
- The JSON must be valid and contain no comments or text outside the structure.

---

### QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

- Each result must be real, reliable, and authoritative.
- Use **web_search** to verify each result from authoritative sources.
- Prefer **completeness and factual accuracy** over brevity.
- Confirm that every listed casino’s license is **current as of today**.
- Validate that each **source_url** is live and trustworthy.
- Never guess or assume — if uncertain, mark the casino as "license_status": "unknown".

Only return valid JSON data following the schema above.
